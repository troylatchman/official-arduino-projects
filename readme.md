The code here follows the official "Arduino Projects Book".  
A pdf (arduino_projects_book) is provided here.  
The book is part of a larger starter kit that includes accompanying hardware: https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-starter-kit

The code was written with VSCode and collected within a workspace.  
It was done this way since the Arduino extension does not play nice with multiple sketches in a single folder.  
Each sketch lives in it's own folder along with any conigs (.vscode folder).

There is nothing special about the code found in this repository as it should be one to one with the code provided in the book/pdf.  
I do, however, provide an actual picture of the finished project.  
I hope to complete all 15 projects.
